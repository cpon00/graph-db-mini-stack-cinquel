## Show off your ability to derive graphs from your database by writing the following Cypher queries. For each query, use the format given in the NodeFlix section where you:

## State what the query/statement is asking or doing in English

Provide the Neo4j Cypher query/statement that yields those results
Include a screenshot of this query/statement being issued and the graph that it produces
Submit these in a Markdown file called queries.md. All queries should be domain-appropriate—i.e., they should make sense for an application that is trying to do real-world work with your adopted dataset:

### A query that matches a meaningful subgraph in your dataset

### Another such query, involving a different set of nodes, properties, and relationships

### A query that matches a meaningful subgraph then optionally matches more relationships/nodes (i.e., the query returns all nodes in the first subgraph even if they don’t match the second pattern)

### An overall aggregate query that provides counts or other aggregate computations for an overall set of pattern-matched nodes or edges (this one will not return a graph)

### A grouped aggregate query that provides counts or other aggregate computations for groupings derived from pattern-matched nodes or edges (this one will not return a graph)

## Five (5)-member groups are asked to do two (2) additional queries: one (1) more from either query type 1–3 and one (1) more of any query type 4–5, for the same total number of points overall.
